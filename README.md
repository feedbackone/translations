We currently support the following languages:

To add a translation for your desired language, please follow the instructions below:

- Add a `.json` file with the [ISO language code](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp) of the desired language to the `locales` folder.
- Only the values of the JSON should be changed; the keys should stay intact.
- Prefer contextual translation over word-to-word.
