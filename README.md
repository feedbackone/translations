# Feedback.one form translations

To add a translation for your desired language, please add a `.json` file with the [ISO language code](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp) of the desired language to the `locales` folder. Use the [en.json](locales/en.json) file as a reference. Only the values of the JSON should be changed; the keys should stay intact.

Prefer contextual translation over word-to-word.
